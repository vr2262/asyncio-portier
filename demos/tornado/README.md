# Running the asyncio-portier Tornado example app

This demo is much like the demo relying party provided by Portier
(https://github.com/portier/demo-rp/blob/master/server.py) put together in the
style of one of Tornado's demo applications
(https://github.com/tornadoweb/tornado/tree/master/demos/blog).

1. Install requirements

    ```
    [demos/tornado]$ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Run the example app

    ```
    [demos/tornado]$ ./server.py
    ```

3. Visit the page

    Open http://localhost:8888/ in your web browser. You should be able to log
    in using Portier.
